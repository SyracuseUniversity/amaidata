_College of Law_

An important goal of the legal system is to guide, constrain, and react to

thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and conduct-assumptions that may or may not be
true. Psychology, as the empirical study of human thoughts, beliefs, attitudes
and conduct, is in an important position to evaluate such assumptions. Over
the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have devoted
substantial attention to the systematic study of law and legal institutions.
At the same time, social scientists are testifying as experts in increasing
numbers, and encouraging courts and policy-makers to use research evidence in
adjudicating court cases and in setting public policy. This course will
provide a survey of research in psychology as it relates to the legal and
political process; in-class activities and demonstrations will form a

legal processes. Our attention then turns to the relationship between
international law and U.S. law, including the principles that govern (and
impede) the application of international law in U.S. courts. Rather than
attempt to canvass the myriad subfields that comprise contemporary public
international law, we devote sustained attention to a selection from among the
following subjects: principles of jurisdiction, international regulatory
regimes and globalization, state claims to natural resources, the law of war,
and international human rights. With this foundation in place, the course
concludes with an invitation to grapple with several perennial critiques of
