**What is FYS 101** First Year Seminar (FYS 101) is a one-credit, semester
long course that engages all first-year and transfer students in guided
conversations, experiential activities, and written assignments about
transitioning to Syracuse University. During this course, students will
explore and explain personal goals for their education at Syracuse University
and develop an understanding of the complex components of identity and how
they relate to multiple communities, including finding points of connection
with the Syracuse University community. **What to Expect** Students will
engage with their peers across disciplines; small class sizes composed of
students from different majors will help students expand their interpersonal
skills. Each section of FYS 101 is taught by a Lead Instructor and a Peer
Leader who will assist students in obtaining knowledge about topics such as
belonging, interdependence, health and wellness, identity, socialization,
prejudice, discrimination, bias, and stereotype. Engagement with academic
articles, podcasts, TedX Talks, social media platforms, videos, campus and
community engagement, and reflection forms the basis for active learning in
the course. **Home College Experience** The FYS 101 Home College Experience
(HCE) provides discipline-specific opportunities for students to connect to
and build community within their home school/college. The Home College
Experience of the FYS 101 course will take place during:

  * Week 6 (October 2 - October 6)
  * Week 9 (October 23 - October 27)
  * Week 14 (December 4 - December 8)

Regularly scheduled FYS 101 classes will not take place during these weeks.
Students will engage in special programming with their home school/college.
HCE programs will range from school/college but will include interactive
outdoor events, performances, registration fairs, engagement opportunities
with school/college-based student organizations and more! HCE will be listed
on your course schedule and information for specific dates and times will be
provided by your school/college. Additional details can be found at:
