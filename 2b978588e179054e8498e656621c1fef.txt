## Course Numbering System

The present system of numbering courses prescribes that all courses use three digits to indicate the course level and/or type of course, and a three-letter subject to indicate the department or college. The following catalog numbering guidelines indicate the level and type of course: |  | Remedial and noncredit courses | 000-099  
---|---|---  
| Freshman-level courses | 100-199  
| Sophomore-level courses | 200-299  
| Junior- and senior-level courses | 300-499  
| Joint undergraduate- and graduate-level courses  
All 500-level courses are defined as being graduate courses. All students should complete the same work and be graded using the graduate grading standard. | 500-599  
| First-year graduate-level courses | 600-699  
| Second year and above graduate-level courses | 700-899  
| Readings, research, and individual study courses at the doctoral level only | 900-996  
| Master's thesis | 997  
| Individualized study program | 998  
| Doctoral dissertation | 999  
  
#### Interpretation

  * The first, or left, digit of the course catalog number indicates level.
  * The second, or middle, digit may or may not indicate the study area, depending upon the curriculum structure of the particular department.

### Glossary of Course Subjects

Each course number is preceded by a three-letter subject that indicates the
area of study. You can view a complete alphabetical list of subjects, together
with the area for which each stands and the college or school in which the
course is taught, by selecting the Courses link.

### Guide To Reading Descriptions

#### Example 1

**CHE 477 - **Proteins and Nucleic Acids Lab** College of Arts & Sciences**  
Crosslisted with: BCM 477  
Double Numbered with: CHE 677  
3 Credits - Offered at least 1x, fall or spring  
Experimental methods for biologically synthesizing and chemically purifying
macromolecules in order to analyze their structure and function, including:
polymerase chain reaction; site-directed mutagenesis; Protein expression and
purification; nucleic acid and protein electrophoresis. Additional work
required of graduate students. PREREQ: CHE 474 or BIO 326 or BIO 575

CHE 477 \- course subject = CHE (Chemistry) (see "Courses ") and catalog
number = 477.

Proteins and Nucleic Acids Lab - course title.

College of Arts and Sciences - the school, college, or academic unit offering
the course.

Crosslisted* with: BCM 477 \- course is crosslisted with a course in
Biochemistry, BCM 477. _*Crosslist: Two or more different subjects, same or
different course numbers, but with the same title and catalog description,
e.g., CHE/BCM 477. Crosslisting may occur within a school or college, or
between schools/colleges._

Double Numbered** with: CHE 677 \- Course is also offered as CHE 677 .
_**Double Number: Same subject, two different course numbers at different
levels, undergraduate and graduate, e.g., CHE 477/677. _Double numbered
courses are numbered no more than 300 apart.

3 Credits - number of academic credits the course carries. Variable credit
courses show a range of credits, e.g. 1-3 credits.

Offered at least 1x fall or spring - Indicates frequency of offering. Courses
may be offered every semester, at least once a year, only in academic years
ending in an odd year (2007-2008) or in an even year (2004-2005); during a
summer session, irregularly, or based on sufficient student interest.

Experimental methods for biologically synthesizing and chemically purifying
macromolecules in order to analyze their structure and function, including:
polymerase chain reaction; site-directed mutagenesis; Protein expression and
purification; nucleic acid and protein electrophoresis. Additional work
required of graduate students. - Course description

PREREQ: CHE 474 or BIO 326 or BIO 575 - A prerequisite (PREREQ) is a course or
condition that must be successfully completed or met before enrollment is
possible in the course described. A course may also have a corequisite
(COREQ), which requires concurrent enrollment.

#### Example 2 - Courses that can be repeated for credit

**SED 340 - Participation in the Professional Development School of
Education**  
Double Numbered with: SED 640  
0-1 Credits - Offered each semester  
Individual involvement in research, discussion and decision making with
teachers, university faculty, and colleagues who are members of the
Professional Development School Cadres and Academies. Repeatable 5 time(s), 2
credits maximum

In this example, "repeatable 5 time(s), 2 credits maximum" appears at the end
of the description. This means the course may be taken and counted more than
once toward fulfillment of degree requirements. In the example, SED 340 can be
repeated up to 5 times, but only for a maximum of 2 credits earned.

## Descriptions Of All-University Courses

All-University courses allow students considerable flexibility in developing
individual academic programs. Students enrolled in any school or college
within the University may enroll in these courses. Some, but not all, all-
University courses are displayed under individual school and college course
listings in this catalog. Whether listed or not, the descriptions are standard
in every program and are provided below.

Experience credit and independent study courses may be elected for one to six
credits, depending on individual arrangements with the participating faculty
member. In selected topics courses, students may earn one to six credits.
Students are advised to check carefully with their faculty advisors and the
dean of their school or college before registering for an all-University
course to be sure that the course will be accepted toward the completion of
their degree requirements.

  * **SELECTED TOPICS (TITLE MAY VARY)**  
(Subject) (Catalog Number) Selected Topics 1-6 credits  
Exploration of a topic (to be determined) not covered by the standard
curriculum but of interest to faculty and students in a particular semester.

    * All Selected Topics Courses end in 00.
    * Two Semester Rules for Selected Topics: *Any course offered twice as selected topics must be "regularized" as a new course before it can be offered again.
  * **EXPERIENCE CREDIT**  
(Subject) (Catalog Number) Experience Credit 1-6 credits  
Participation in a discipline- or subject-related experience. Students must be

  * **INTERNATIONAL COURSE**  
(Subject) (Catalog Number) (Title and Name of Institution) 1-12 credits

institution outside the United States. Syracuse Abroad obtains approval from
the SU academic department to award SU credit and to assign the course level.
Students register for the course at the foreign institution and is graded
according to the educational institution's practice. Grade is taken from the
foreign institution-issued transcript, with a conversion scale used where
appropriate.

  * **INDEPENDENT STUDY**

  * **HONORS THESIS**  
(Subject) 499 Honors Thesis 3-6 credits  
The "499" number is used as needed by all departments in the University.
Students sign up for Honors Thesis the same way they do for the other all-
University courses - by filling out a form at registration each time they
register for the course.

The following is the course numbering system for all-university courses which,
along with the departmental subject, constitutes an integral part of the
course description:

### Course Numbering for All-University Courses

**Type of Course** | **Lower Division** | **Upper Division** | **First Year Graduate** | **Advanced Graduate**  
---|---|---|---|---  
**Selected Topics** | 200 | 400 | 600 | 900  
**Experience Credit** | 270 | 470 | 670 | 970  
**International Course** | 280 | 480 | 680 | 980  
**Independent Study** | 290 | 490 | 690 | 990  
  
The 100, 300, 500, 700, 800 series may also be used for all-university
courses.
