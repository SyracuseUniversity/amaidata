### About the College

The College of Arts and Sciences (A&S) is Syracuse University's first and
largest college. It comprises 15 departments that offer more than 30 master's
and Ph.D. programs. A&S is a primary contributor to the University's R1 ("Very
High Research") designation due to its strong emphasis on participatory
research across disciplines.

As the home of the liberal arts, A&S offers a range of many internationally
known master's and Ph.D. programs in the natural sciences, mathematics and the
humanities, such as in physics, creative writing, forensic science and art and
music histories.

A&S' broad areas of specialty include:

  * communication and human expression;
  * environment and sustainability;
  * intercultural competency and social justice;
  * medicine, health and wellness; and,
  * the origins of the universe and development of the Earth.

Graduate students are immersed in an environment of academic rigor, research,
and creativity where they develop the tools and skills needed to effect change
and generate new knowledge and ideas. They work alongside and are mentored by
top faculty in research that addresses issues such as disease, racial
injustice, human behavior and climate change-and examines the world by
analyzing the workings of physical phenomena and exploring the reaches of
human experience and expression.

Students have numerous avenues, within A&S and through interdisciplinary
degree options with other Syracuse University schools and colleges, to pursue
their academic interests, gain professional experience and advance in their
chosen fields.
