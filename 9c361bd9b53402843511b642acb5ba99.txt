### About the College

State University of New York  
College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF)

Office of the President

The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry
(ESF) adjoins the Syracuse University campus and is closely associated with
the University. The College is a doctoral-granting institution of the State
University of New York. ESF enrolls approximately 2,350 students, including
550 at the graduate level.

The College has extensive modern laboratories, classrooms, and equipment and
instrumentation. Off-campus facilities include 25,000 acres of forest land at
eight locations - four in the Adirondacks, three elsewhere in New York state
and one in Costa Rica, used for instruction, demonstration, and research. Two-
year programs leading to the associate's degree in forest technology,
surveying technology, and environmental and resources conservation are offered
at The Ranger School in Wanakena, New York.

A variety of master's and doctoral programs are also available at ESF.
Syracuse University juniors and seniors are invited to learn more about these
programs and about ways to accelerate admission into graduate programs by
inquiring at 227 Bray Hall.

ESF students have the same privileges as SU students with regard to use of
dining halls, library facilities, testing services, and athletic and
recreational facilities. They also share the wide range of social and cultural
resources available at the University. Students at ESF and Syracuse University
take courses on both campuses to enrich and complement their major programs.
