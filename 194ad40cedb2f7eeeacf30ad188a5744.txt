### About the School

David Van Slyke, Dean  
200 Eggers Hall

The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs was established in 1924
to teach citizenship to all Syracuse University undergraduates. In partnership
with the College of Arts and Sciences , we offer an outstanding liberal arts
education. The Maxwell School is home to six social science disciplines,
interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate programs and graduate
professional programs that educate students for diverse careers in the public,
private, and nonprofit sectors here and abroad.

With its 170 faculty members, 95 staff, 750 graduate students and 2,000
undergraduate majors, the Maxwell School is dedicated to research and teaching
excellence for engaged citizenship and public impact.

Maxwell programs rank highly among their peers because the School attracts
talented faculty and students, produces high quality scholarship, and develops
students into global leaders and engaged citizens.

The Maxwell School participates in students' knowledge and skill development
through the Shared Competencies, Syracuse University's institutional learning
goals that highlight the knowledge and skills students can expect to gain
through their major courses, liberal arts requirements, and co-curricular
activities.

For a complete listing of faculty associated with the Maxwell School, see the
Faculty section of this catalog.

### Study Abroad

Half of all Maxwell students and most students pursuing the International
Relations, BA and BS degrees take advantage of the Syracuse Abroad programs.
Study Abroad may take place at one of Syracuse University's seven overseas
centers or with one of our world partners. Many students find internships
abroad to help them develop their skills and launch their careers.

Students also have the option to spend a semester in Washington, DC, at the
Maxwell-in-Washington program, located at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a top-ranked global think tank.

### Undergraduate Majors and Minors

Maxwell is home to the social sciences, as well as to interdisciplinary policy
and international relations programs. Its faculty members teach courses in
each of the disciplines, offer interdisciplinary courses, such as the
foundational MAX Courses (MAX 123 Critical Issues for the United States and
MAX 132 Global Community), and provide an array of majors and minors.
Undergraduate degrees are offered in anthropology; citizenship and civic
engagement; economics; environment, sustainability, and policy; geography;
history; international relations; law, society, and policy; political science;
policy studies; and sociology.

Students may take multiple majors within the social sciences or pursue
additional majors in areas outside of the Maxwell School. They can also minor
in most programs. Many of our undergraduate programs offer opportunities for
internships and applied research. They also offer the opportunity to earn
distinction in their majors. Students who graduate with distinction typically
are selected for the recognition, conduct independent research with one or
more faculty members, and write a scholarly paper based on their research.
