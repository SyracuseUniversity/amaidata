### About the College

The College of Professional Studies is the home of part-time and professional
studies at Syracuse University. The College offers market-sensitive and
professionally focused online and residential undergraduate degrees, graduate
degrees, credit certificates, and work-force ready alternative credentials,
such as badges, micro-degrees, non-credit certificates, and executive
education. The College also offers unique and innovative pre-college programs
for high school students, and language and cultural development programs for
matriculated and non-matriculated international students. Part-time
residential undergraduate and graduate students attending Syracuse University
schools and colleges are supported by the College of Professional Studies'
academic administrative services team.

The College of Professional Studies participates in students' knowledge and
skill development through the Shared Competencies, Syracuse University's
institutional learning goals that highlight the knowledge and skills students
can expect to gain through their major courses and liberal arts requirements.

#### Important Note for Non-matriculated Graduate Students

The SU Graduate School's regulations strongly encourage anyone enrolling at
the graduate level to take no more than two courses (six credits) before being
admitted to a graduate program of study. There are limitations on credits
completed on a non-matriculated basis that may later be applied toward a
specific graduate program. Students should consult the specific academic
department. If you are about to enroll for courses that will take you beyond
an accumulated total of 12 graduate credits (four three-credit courses), you
should (1) take immediate steps to become a matriculated degree candidate, and
(2) secure written permission from the appropriate academic department to
continue to take its graduate courses as a non-matriculated student.

For an application for graduate study, call 315-443-4492 or visit the web
site.

### English Language Institute

English Language Institute (ELI) courses are designed for international
students and professionals who are interested in short-term or long-term study
to improve their English skills. This full-time intensive program is offered
through the College of Professional Studies. Five levels of Academic English
courses are offered. Many of the students have been conditionally admitted to
Syracuse University and need to increase their English proficiency before
enrolling in a degree program. Completion of the level 4 (high intermediate)
course will waive the university's TOEFL requirement for most undergraduate
and some graduate programs.

Courses of varying length can be designed for individuals or groups with
specific needs and disciplines (e.g., architecture, business, engineering,
etc.). The English for Lawyers program, offered every summer, is an example of
this type of specialization where students can prepare before starting in an
LL.M. (Master of Laws) program at an American university. The ELI also offers
English for Architects and English for Information Professionals for students
who will be pursuing a Masters' degree in those areas at Syracuse University.

Highly qualified instructors, a great deal of personal attention, and
intensive exposure to English language instruction enable students to make the
necessary progress. Enrollment is limited and admission is by application
only. For more information about the ELI, call 315-443-8571, email
elimail@syr.edu, or visit the website at eli.syr.edu.
