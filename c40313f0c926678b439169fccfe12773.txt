Syracuse University's Shared Competencies are six institutional learning goals that enhance undergraduate education through an integrated learning approach. Undergraduate students develop competencies through their major degree courses, liberal arts requirements, and co-curricular experiences. The Shared Competencies enable students to communicate their learning experience, provide pathways for academic development, and integrate different aspects of a Syracuse University education. Each competency includes corresponding framing language that communicates the content of that competency to educators and learners. The framing language suggests a range of knowledge, skills, and attributes that each competency entails. | _**Competency**_ | _**Framing Language**_
